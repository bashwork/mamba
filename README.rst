Mamba Messaging Server
===========================================================

What is Starling
-----------------------------------------------------------
Starling is a powerful but simple messaging server that enables reliable
distributed queuing with an absolutely minimal overhead. It speaks the
MemCache protocol for maximum cross-platform compatibility. Any language
that speaks MemCache can take advantage of Starling's queue facilities. 


What is Mamba
-----------------------------------------------------------
All that...but in python


Why?
-----------------------------------------------------------
Because The Office was a rerun and because Peafowl was doing it with
a threaded server instead of an asynchronous/event driven server.


Why name it Mamba?
-----------------------------------------------------------
Because I googled for a fast snake, and black mamba came up.
I also searched pypi for existing projects named mamba (and
I guess I forgot to search github...) and found none.
Also name ideas are great at two in the morning.


Can I use it?
-----------------------------------------------------------
Until your heart is content.  It is released under the BSD license
so you can use it for open, closed, commercial, etc projects.


What if I find something broken?
-----------------------------------------------------------
Open a ticket on the `issue tracker <http://github.com/bashwork/mamba/issues>`_
and I will get to it when I have time.

If you want a feature request, do the same thing, and I will get to
it sometime depending on how large of a request it is.
